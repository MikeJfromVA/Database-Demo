## Database Demo

This repository contains materials from a database course I taught at Christopher Newport University. The materials here are meant to supplement a text and other material containing a firm background in entity/relationship modeling, relational databases, normalization, and database administration. 

Most demos require a working knowledge of Docker, which is covered in the tutorial files here. Start with SQL which covers the initial Docker installation.

Topics :

[SQL : SQL & PostgreSQL demonstrating DDL, DML, relationships, triggers.](SQL)

[Big Data : Hadoop, Python, Neo4j](BigData)

[ORM : Java+Database connection through JDBC, then MyBatis](ORM)
